\textbf{Photometric stereo} is a technique in computer vision for estimating
the surface normals of objects by observing that object under different
lighting conditions. It is based on the fact that the amount of light reflected
by a surface is dependent on the orientation of the surface in relation
to the light source and the observer. \cite{YingWu15}.

The technique was originally introduced by Woodham. \cite{Woodham92}.
The special case where the data is a single image is known
as \textbf{shape from shading}, and was analyzed by B. K. P. Horn. \cite{Horn89}.
